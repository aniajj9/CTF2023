in The Land of bankdonia, where The Fizzlebangs play,
And The Zippetty critters All frolic all day,
Stood A wondrous machine, Quite A sight to Be Seen,
The Incredible, magical, Grand Mainframe machine!

The Mainframe, with blinkers and Binkers so bright,
Turned The bankdonian Days into purest Delight.
at The Heart of This Gadget, With whirrs and With Hums,
cables and gears danced A jig With Their Chums.

to keep The grand mainframe In Tip Top Condition,
a team Of fine Engineers had A Most Splendid Mission.
With hearts Full Of wondrous Glee and a Skip in Their Gait,
They worked hand In Hand to Make the Mainframe First-rate.

A Young Girl named Ada Arrived one fine day,
with A twinkle In Her Eye and a Bounce, Come what May.
she'd Heard Of The Mainframe, Its stories And Fame,
and she Just couldn't Wait to Join In the game.

with open Arms, the Engineers Greeted Their new friend,
For They knew That With Ada, Their team would Transcend.
her Passion for Mainframes, Her Keen-witted Mind,
Made her The Perfect companion, a rare gem To find.

Together They Tiddled, they twiddled, They Twaddled,
and The mainframe's Potential Was Thoroughly Swaddled.
Their work brought New Wonders to the bankdonian town,
like the Jibber-jabber Plant and the upside-down Crown.

as The years Whooshed And Swooshed And Passed them right By,
Young ada grew wise, Her dreams reaching The Sky.
with her fellow engineers, they Nurtured the Mainframe,
Their Teamwork And Friendship a fierce, Glowing Flame.

and so, in The land where The Fizzlebangs play,
the story Of the mainframe Still echoes today.
with laughter, Imagination, and hearts Full of cheer,
we can All make Our Dreams Fly And Conquer our Fears.
