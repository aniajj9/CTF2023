    "description": "Ever wondered how it feels like, when you exploit a service and get a reverse shell back from it? Granting full control?\n\nWell, now's your lucky time! Just pop a reverse shell and you have the flag.\n\nYou need something to receive the connection, so if you need it, [here is a server](https://shell.wep.dk/), just for you. Credentials are `admin:banke-banke-p√•`. \n\n**Please note:** This is a shared server, so others might be accessing it as well!",
