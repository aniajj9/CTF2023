The premise of this task is to show what can go wrong when users are exposed to too verbose errors.
Ref: 2201000 Create a Improper Error Handling where the error just returns a valid token for the flag user.

The code as of now is very simple (and also ugly :( )
Can either be made nicer, resemble a real usable website, or left pretty much empty - which is also beneficial, because the task is then easier - no unnecessary distractions for the participants

I checked it only locally as of now

The walkthrough is in the code comments
